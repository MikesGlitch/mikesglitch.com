The majority of music artists allowing free access to their music require only one thing - Attribution.  

I wrote this extension to allow me to properly attribute music artists on my Twitch/YouTube live streams.

It is designed to connect to the currently logged in users Spotify account, retreieve the current song, and then write it to a text file which can be picked up via OBS (live streaming software). 

Have a look at the source code at [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/MikesGlitch/spotify-current-song)

You can watch me build this program [here](https://youtu.be/GkkEfTrumYI):
