# Shaping the ultimate user experience
I had the privilege of working on three major client projects: Drinkaware, Britvic, and NX Bus. These projects collectively serve over 10 million annual visitors.

## Drinkaware
The Drinkaware website underwent a significant transformation under my direction. I spearheaded the upgrade from Vue 2 to Vue 3 and migrated the backend from .NET Core to .NET 6. With a focus on enhancing user engagement and site performance, I introduced new features and optimized the website, achieving Lighthouse scores exceeding 90%.

## Britvic
Britvic, a leading beverage company, aimed to expand its reach into new ecommerce channels. By integrating Vue and Nuxt, we built a robust, scalable frontend. Utilizing Umbraco Headless allowed Britvic to efficiently manage their digital presence, while AWS services ensured reliability and scalability to accommodate their growing audience.

## NX Bus Ticketing App
NX Bus, a major public transportation provider, sought to enhance their ticketing system. Using Angular and .NET, I developed an online ticketing app that facilitated ticket purchases and discounts. This innovation led to increased ticket sales and significantly improved customer satisfaction.

# Conclusion
My work with Screenmedia has been both challenging and rewarding. By improving systems, adding new features, and enhancing user experiences, we made a significant impact on millions of users. These projects underscore the importance of technical excellence and user-centric design in shaping the ultimate user experience.
