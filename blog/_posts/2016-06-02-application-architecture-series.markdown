I am starting to write a new Learning Series on my [www.codereviewer.co.uk](www.codereviewer.co.uk) website today which will outline some interesting architectures, who uses them, and how/why they are designed in the way that they are.  The first article I’ll be writing is about Flux, which is an application architecture that FaceBook uses for building client-side web applications.  The architecture looks very interesting and look forward to concluding it, though it might take a few weeks.

Other architectures/patterns I have planned to write about are:

- DDD
- CQRS
- Microservices
- Model-View-Controller
- If there are any others you would like to read about, comment down below and I’ll see what I can do!
